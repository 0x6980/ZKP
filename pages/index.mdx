# Welcome to 0x6980 ZKP learning journey!!

## My mistakes
- I thought all zkSNARK structure uses Elliptic Curve and pairing!!
- I always used summary of zkSNARK Concepts. donâ€™t. Dive in details.

## SNARK
**Polynomial-IOP** and **Polynomial Commitment Scheme**, mixing together generates the SNARK.

### Polynomial-IOP (Interactive Oracle Proof)
- P's first message in the protocol is a **polynomial** $h$.
    - V does not learn $h$ in full.
    - The description size of $h$ is as large as the circuit.
    - V is permitted to evaluate $h$ at, say, **one** point.
    - After that P and V execute a standard interactive proof.
- There are several different polynomial **IOP**.
- Three classes of polynomial-IOP
    - Based on **interactive proofs (IPs)**.
    - Based on **multi-prover interactive proofs (MIPs)**.
    - Based on **constant-round polynomial IOPs**.
        - Example: Marlin, Plonk.

### Polynomial Commitment Scheme
- P binds itself to a polynomial $h$ by sending a short string **$com_h$**.
- V can choose $x$ and ask P to evaluate $h(x)$
- P sends $y$, the evaluation, plus a proof $\pi$ that $y$ is consistent with $com_h$ and $x$.
- P can not produce a convincing proof fo an incorrect evaluation.
- $com_h$ and $\pi$ short and easy to generate.
- $\pi$ is easy to check.
- There are several polynomial commitments.
- Three classes of polynomial commitments.
    - Based on **pairing + trusted setup** (not transparent not post-quantum).
        - Example: KZG commitment scheme.
        - Unique property: constant sized evaluation proofs.
        - Are homomorphic: Lead to efficient **batching/amortization** P and V costs.
            - e.g. when proving knowledge of several different witnesses.
            - addition under the commitment: take two commitment and derive the commitment to the sum of the two commited objects.
            - $com_p \times com_q = com_{p+q}$
    - Based on **discrete logarithm** (transparent, not post-quantum).
        - Example: IPA/Bulletproofs. Hyrax, Dory. (IPA: Inner product Argument)
        - Are homomorphic.
    - Based on **IOP + hashing (error-correcting code)** (transparent, post-quantum).
        - Example: FRI. Ligero, Brakedown, Orion

### Mix and match
- To get different trade-offs between P time, proof size, setup assumptions, etc.
- Transparency and plausible post-quantum security determined entirely by the polynomial commitment scheme used.

#### [Any polynomial-IOP] + IPA/Bulletproofs polynomial commitment scheme
- Example: Plonk polynomial-IOP with IPA/Bulletproofs: Halo2-ZCach
- Pros: Shortest proof among transparent setup.
- Cons: Slow V

#### [Any polynomial-IOP] + FRI polynomial commitment
- Example: STARTK, Fractal, Aurora, Virgo, Ligero++
- Pros: Shortest proofs amongst plausibly post-quantum SNARKs.
- Cons: Proofs are still large (at least hundreds of KB depending on what security you want)

#### [MIPs and IPs] + [fast-prover polynomial commitments]
- Example: Sparten, Brakedown, Orion, Orion+.
- Pros: Fastest P in the literature, plausibly post-quantum + transparent if polynomial commitment is.
- Cons: Bigger proof than two category mentioned above.

### Non-transparent SNARKs
#### Linear-PCP based
- Example: Groth16
- Pros: Shortest proofs size (3 group elements), Fastest V.
- Cons: Not only is there a trusted setup but it is **Circuit-specific** trusted setup, slow and space-intensive P, not post-quantum.

#### Constant-round polynomial-IOP + KZG polynomial commitment
- Examples: Marlin-KZG, Plonk-KZG
- Pros: **Universal** trusted setup.
- Cons: 
    - Proofs are almost $4x-6x$ larger than Groth16, P is slower than Groth16, also not post-quantum.
    - Counterpoint for P: can use more flexible intermediate representations than circuit and R1CS.
