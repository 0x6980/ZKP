# Polynomial Commitment
- Suppose $q(x)$ is the polynomial with degree n that we want to commit.
- Then, we generate Vandermonde matrix of polynomial $q(x)$: matrix $P \in F^{n \times n}$.
- Encode each row of $P$. So each row $= x \in F^n$.
- This encode generate a matrix of $n \times m$.
- Commit to each column of the encoded matrix using Merkle tree.

##
- P Merkle-commit to all evaluations of the polynomial $q$
- When V requests $q(r)$, P reveals the associated leaf along with opening information.
- Two problems:
    - The numbers of leaf is $\vert F\vert$, which means the time to compute the commitment is at least $\vert F\vert$.
        - Big problem when working over large fields ($\vert F\vert = 2^{64}\space\text{or}\space 2^{128}$).
        - Want time proportional to the degree bound d.
    - V does not know if $q$ has degree at most $n$.
- Fixing first problem
    - Rather than P Merkle-committing all $n-1$ evaluations of $q$, P only Merkle-commits to evaluations $q(x)$ for those $x$ in a carefully chosen subset $\Omega$ of $F_p$.
    - $\Omega$ has size $\rho^{-1}n$ for some constant $\rho \leq \frac{1}{2}$
        - $\Omega^{-1} \geq 2$ is called the "FRI blowup factor".
        - $\rho$ is called the "rate" od Reedâ€“Solomon code used.
